= ABAC server

ABAC server is an implementation of attribute based access control,
which allows writing access rules based on relations between parties and attributes defined within access context.
Most of the configuration can be done via administration console, which can be accessed under server's base URL.

Only users with role 'ROLE_ADMIN' can access the console!
