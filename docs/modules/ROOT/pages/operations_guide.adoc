== Preface

This guide describes how to administer ABAC Server.

== Using the ABAC Server

ABAC server is an implementation of attribute based access control,
which allows writing access rules based on relations between parties and attributes defined within access context.
Most of the configuration can be done via administration console, which can be accessed under server's base URL.
Only users with role 'ROLE_ADMIN' can access the console!

=== Parties and relations
In ABAC, we are assessing relationships between different entities - parties. Each instance of a party is defined by its unique id and a set of external identifiers coming from external systems
- for example a patient has and EHR id from EHR server and a Patient resource id from Demographics server.
A party can be of any type you define: a user, a patient, user group, care plan, other resources - anything you need to refer to in the ABAC system.

Relationship between two parties is defined by a relation - each party can have any number of relations of any allowed types between them.

==== Party and relation type
Each instance of a party and relation must be of a specific type (user, patient, doctor...).

image::party_type.png[Creating a party type]

Relation type also defines which party types can be the source of a relationship and which
party types can be the target.

=== Policies

A policy is a "rule" that returns a boolean answer - Yes or No, and can be used for controlling access or filtering the resources. If the policy returns a positive result, the action or access is allowed, otherwise content is filtered or inaccessible.
Policies are created and updated within ABAC admin console and are written in Policy Definition Language (PDL). PDL has predefined policy functions to evaluate party relations and context variables.
Context variables are accessed with prefix 'ctx' - for example ctx.user returns id of user. Literal function parameters must be encapsulated with single quatation marks - for example 'ROLE_USER'
Policy functions can be further grouped and evaluated using function quantifiers - any, all...

==== Policy functions

* hasAnyRole('ROLE1', 'ROLE2', ...)
** Returns true if the calling user has any of the roles passed as a function parameters. Can have any number of roles as parameters. +
Example: hasAnyRole('ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_ADMIN') - returns true if user has either ROLE_USER or ROLE_ADMIN.

* hasRelation(sourceParty, 'RELATION_TYPE', targetParty)
** Returns true if the relation of provided type exists between source and target party. +
Example: hasRelation(ctx.user, 'PERSONAL_PHYSICIAN', ctx.patient) - returns true if context user has relation of type PERSONAL_PHYSICIAN with context patient.

* hasAnyRelation(sourceParty, targetParty, 'RELATION_ONE', 'RELATION_TWO', ...)
** Returns true if any of the relation of provided types exists between source and target party. +
Example: hasAnyRelation(ctx.user, ctx.patient, 'PERSONAL_PHYSICIAN', 'ATTENDING_DOCTOR') - returns true if context user has relation of type PERSONAL_PHYSICIAN or ATTENDING_DOCTOR with context patient.

* hasRelationChain(sourceParty, targetParty, 'RELATION_ONE', 'RELATION_TWO', ...)
** Returns true if there exists a transitive relationship between source and target party consisting of relation types in same order as specified by function parameters. +
Example: hasRelationChain(ctx.user, ctx.patient, 'MEMBER', 'ASSIGNED_TO') - returns true if context user has a relation of type MEMBER with any party (for example CARE_TEAM)
         which has a relation of type ASSIGNED_TO with context patient.

* isAuthenticated()
** Returns true if the calling user is authenticated

==== Policy quantifiers

* ALL_OF(f1, f2, q(f3, f4,...), ...)

** Returns true if all the parameter evaluations return true. +
Example: ALL_OF(hasAnyRole('ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_ADMIN'), hasRelation(ctx.user, 'PERSONAL_PHYSICIAN', ctx.patient)) - returns true if user has either ROLE_USER or ROLE_ADMIN and if context user has relation of type PERSONAL_PHYSICIAN with context patient.

* ANY_OF(f1, f2, q(f3, f4,...), ...)
** Returns true if any of the parameter evaluations return true. +
Example: ANY_OF(hasAnyRole('ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_ADMIN'), hasRelation(ctx.user, 'PERSONAL_PHYSICIAN', ctx.patient)) - returns true if user has either ROLE_USER or ROLE_ADMIN or if context user has relation of type PERSONAL_PHYSICIAN with context patient.

==== Executing policies

Policies can be executed via REST api HTTP POST at base server URL under /rest/v1/policy/execute/name/\{policyName} . Postman collection for the example scenario xref:attachment$abac_collection.json[JSON]

=== Example scenarios

==== Relation chain example
Let's create an ABAC set of policies that will control access to specific resources, in our case a resource named CarePlan, that is managed in our Demographics server.
We would like to group doctors in different care teams and allow each care team access to different care plans. The party types we need are User (doctors), CarePlan and CareTeam.

To start with, we have four doctors, Jessie, John, Kira and Kent. They all represent a PARTY of PARTY TYPE User.
We also define two PARTIES of PARTY TYPE CareTeam, namely Team_J and Team_K and two PARTIES of PARTY TYPE CarePlan, Plan_A and Plan_B
Next, we define a RELATION of MEMBER and make Jessie and John MEMBERs to Team_J, Kira and Kent MEMBERs to Team_K.
We also define a RELATION of type ASSIGNED_TO. Plan_A and Plan_B are two PARTIES, where first is ASSIGNED_TO to TEAM_J and second to TEAM_K.

So for example if we want to allow access to patient resources only to system administrators and doctors which are members of care teams that are responsible for patients care plan,
we can define a following policy named DEMOGRAPHICS_CAREPLAN_READ and add it to Demographics server configuration:

* ANY_OF(hasAnyRole('ROLE_ADMIN'), hasRelationChain(ctx.user, ctx.careplan, 'MEMBER', 'ASSIGNED_TO'))

==== Token attribute example
In this case the user token contains attribute value `workplace_id` which denotes identifier of an ORGANIZATION and restricts the user to patients that the ORGANIZATION MANAGES. For this scenario we'll create:

* a Party Type `ORGANIZATION`
* Relation Type `MANAGES` which is defined by Allowed Source Party Type=`ORGANIZATION` and Allowed Target Party Type=`PATIENT`

and given these three parties:

.these property values:
[source,properties]
----
# SSO token attribute mapper
sso.mapper[0].tokenAttributePath=workplace_id
sso.mapper[0].contextKeyValue=workplaceId
----
.and `USER` auth token that contains:
[source,json,linenums,highlight='14']
----
{
  "workplace_id": "13602"
}
----
.we can create a policy `FHIR_PATIENT_READ`:
[source,javascript]
----
hasRelation(ctx.workplaceId, 'MANAGES', ctx.existingResource.id)
----
.and execute it by calling:
[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
POST /rest/v1/policy/execute/name/FHIR_PATIENT_READ HTTP/1.1
Host: <abac_server_host_and_port>
Authorization: Bearer <token_value>
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 55

{
  "existingResource": {
    "id": "13603"
  }
}
